# RasPi-Robotic-Arm-Control

This is a collection of files of stuff I've worked on for a high school computer class capstone project.  
The goal was to be able to control the OWI Edge 535 robotic arm (NOT the USB version because I'm cheap) with a Raspberry Pi to make it reflect on a chessboard the moves made in a command line chess program.
Sadly, the chess part doesn't work, because of the limitations of the robotic arm kit (it's not precise enough because of gear slippage and movement inconsistencies, but more about that later).  

(However, with more time and either some potentiometers, modified servos, small enough DC motors with encoders, or some infrared sensors and gearbox modification, the chess part is totally feasible.  Buying and getting that stuff to work, however, is beyond the time frame and budget of the high school project.)

I was able to manually control the arm with the Pi, and whipped up a little GUI that mimics the software that comes with the USB version of the arm (just buttons to move each motor each direction).  
Included in this are all the files I used (or was going to use) for it.
